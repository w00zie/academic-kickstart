# Podcasts

[**Artificial Intelligence Podcast**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4) - A podcast about AI & beyond with a lot of interesting interviewees. Sometimes the interviewer gets a little too much philosophical (not in a good way) but generally speaking is good content, imo.

[**Il podcast di Alessandro Barbero: Lezioni e Conferenze di Storia**](https://www.spreaker.com/show/il-podcast-di-alessandro-barbero) - History lessons by one of the most known historians in Italy (in Italian).

# Random stuff

[**Papers With Code**](https://paperswithcode.com/) - A site where you can dig among papers (in the field of ML) with open source code officialy released.

[**Haskell for Imperative Programmers**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe7Ei6viL6jGp1Rfu0dil1JH1SHk9bgDV) - A playlist for starting out Haskell programming. I've watched a few episodes and I liked the teaching style.
